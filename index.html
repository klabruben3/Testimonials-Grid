            <p class="review-1-white">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br>honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="review-2-white">" I was an EMT for many years  before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

            <p class="review-1-white">The team was very<br>supportive and kept me<br>motivated</p>
            <br>
            <p class="review-2-white">" I started as a total newbie with<br>virtually no coding skills. I now work<br>as a mobile engineer for a big<br>company. This was one of the best<br>investments I've made in myself. "</p>

            <p class="review-1-gray">Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="review-2-gray">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br>some structure from proffessionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former student of theirs<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>fact, I've often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>development experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving mutiple<br>offers. 100% recommended! "</p>

            <p class="review-1-white">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from<br>their experiences was easy.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="review-2-white">" The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br>program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br>myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br>personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</p>
